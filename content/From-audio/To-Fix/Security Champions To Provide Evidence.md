### Security champions to provide evidence

An interesting discussion thread I contributed to recently concerns the need for security champions to provide evidence for the tickets they open.

When the security champion opens issues, it creates an efficient workflow. The next step is to provide strong evidence about the issue, and if they can, that is often an issue in itself.

A good exercise for hackathons or for get-togethers, for example, is to come to the table.  The security champions should come to the table and say, *"Hey, I think there is a problem, I think there is an issue. Can we prove it?"* 

That is the key to the game: you should build proof, and provide evidence for the findings you open. You should allow the person who accepts the risk, or makes a decision, to really understand the context and implications of their decision.

This is why the exploits are critical; they can demonstrate potential consequences and solutions. *"This is what might happen, this is the problem and sometimes you address it in production, sometimes in QA; it depends on the impact".* The key to all this is demonstrable evidence.
