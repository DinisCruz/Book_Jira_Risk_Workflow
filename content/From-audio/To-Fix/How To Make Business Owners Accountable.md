### How to make business owners accountable 

To make business owners accountable, make them click on 'accept'. This isn't the moment that they will accept the risk; rather it is the moment where they will read the risk. 

This exercise has long term gains; it contributes towards changing the culture and finding ways to create a positive workflow.

Sometimes you should be aggressive, and sometimes you should be harsh and make teams accountable. Remember, this game has already been played; the question is whether you control the rules of the game.

The thing to understand is that most people will only read the risk, and pay attention, when they realize they are accountable. Don't be frustrated if this happens to you, if you think you have discussed a topic and explained the risks, but then discover that no one was listening to you.  This situation is no worse than where you were before you made them realize their level of accountability.
