### One number to define risk

A very interesting idea given to me by a CISO friend is to reduce all AppSec and InfoSec activities into one number, present that number to the board, and use it to measure the current risk profile.

In a way, the number is a collation of multiple numbers which are now easier to understand and map. And this is very tightly connected to the idea of maturity models where you measure the maturity of multiple teams, multiple systems, or multiple products, and then you gain a better understanding of who is doing what.

What I really like about the maturity models is that they allow the temperature to be defined in the actual model, so they allow a much more objective and pragmatic way of looking at the problem, and looking at the issues.  This is an effective way to control the temperature and apply pressure to the right places.

The maturity models also show you where to act, because when you look at the multiple patterns and activities in the maturity model, you see which activities are working, or aren't working, and which activities are being done or not being done. That is a great way to analyze the organization.

In fact, even the individual items of the maturity model sometimes need their own maturity models. When you say you have a security champion, the whole security champion world has its own maturity model, where in the beginning it is the binary, do you have one or not? 

Then you start to look at how effective or knowledgeable they are, and how well they perform their duties. The same thing applies to code reviews, to path chains, to the management of dependencies, and to threat analysis. 

All of these are things you should measure, where the maturity model leads to a higher one, which eventually leads to a number.

It is quite a nice workflow to do across the enterprise, and it also scales very well.
