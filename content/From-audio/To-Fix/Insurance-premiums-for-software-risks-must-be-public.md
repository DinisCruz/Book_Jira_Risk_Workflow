### Insurance premiums for software risks must be public

As the insurance industry matures, more and more companies will choose to insure their risks instead of writing secure code or fixing the applications. It is essential that those values, and those insurance premiums, are made public, because those contracts will measure the security of different companies.

The problem is we need ways to measure company security. We need to measure security in ways that reward the client, so that the entity making a purchasing decision can choose A, B, or C.

We can't have a situation where the only measuring sticks are features, reputation, cost, and maybe some performance. We need security to be in the mix, and we need companies to pay the price for not having adequate security.

Now, if the customer chooses to go with a particular vendor that clearly doesn't have application security practices, and is not doing the right thing, that is simply market economics at work.

But my experience is that won't happen. Clients are becoming more savvy, and if they can insure the multiple products that they are consuming, then they will put pressure on the companies they deal with, and they will vote with their decisions, which is what you want to see happen.

This situation will evolve as the insurance company grows and matures. It will push a much better validation of the issues, and this will bring a huge amount of rationality, data points, and data analysis into what is at risk, and how you can measure, name, and define the risk. We need to ensure those mappings, and that information, is all public.

Although this is something that could easily not happen, I feel that because the industry is still immature, we can point it in the right direction from now on.
