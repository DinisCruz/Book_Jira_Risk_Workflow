### Use Git to manage documents

One of the main challenges of becoming a developer is understanding concepts that are intrinsic to the development workflow. Version control is one of the most important of these concepts. Furthermore, version control is an area in which I find huge weakness in students and IT professionals, because they lack development experience, and they have not experienced the power of version control.

This is hard to understand until you use version control and understand its power, which lies in managing content in a distributive way.

The power of Git, and the reason it is so successful for data version controls is that it radically changes the way you think. It radically changes the way you collaborate in creating original source code, but it has much wider applications than code. There are amazing cases all over the world where Git is used to manage and track changes to laws and many other things.

So, Git is growing but not quickly enough. How do you recommend Git as a version control system to someone who is stuck in a loop of managing a Word document or an Excel spreadsheet?  Even if, in the beginning, they only use Git to manage the binaries, this will expose them to central repositories, pushing data, Git flows, or GitLab Flow, pull requests, merge requests, etc.

Eventually, you want to see them move into native and tech space data storage. If someone previously used an Excel spreadsheet, you want to see them move to storing the data points in a format that can be easily read.

This is important, because diffing and versioning are essential when you have a team collaborating on a text. The challenge here is not in the first review, but in the second, third, fourth, and fifth reviews where you don't want to read the whole text again, you just want to see the edits, especially when you asked for changes to be made. You want to verify that the person you asked to make the change understood your request, and you want to check that they made the change in the right place. 

During the second and subsequent reviews, reading the whole document doesn't work. The same thing happens with code changes: you can track changes, but after one or two reviews you will need something more. 

Tracking changes also lacks one of the pillars of Git, which is to push the person who requests a change to tidy the text and make it easier for the person who will read and edit the work.

So, when you store the data natively, or when you store the data in a text-based format, you can then store the digitization part into a spreadsheet. The logic will be that your visualization won't substantially change, what will change are the data points and recapturing. These will scale.

Eventually you should move into a more web-based, code-based, format, where instead of using Excel, you use another web interface, maybe a website, or technology such as D3, Vis, or .js. When you take a spreadsheet, and codify it on a Git repo or on a website, this is already a great programming task.

For these reasons, I highly recommend students and info-sec practitioners who want to get into coding to start with Git.
