### The media must reinvent itself

The media must reinvent itself to become a reliable source of truth. And one way to do that is to hyper-link proof.

As infotainment, and the post-truth political culture grows in influence, the media, which is supposed to be the fourth estate, must win back its confidence.

And I think that it needs to do this in two ways. Firstly, it needs to start being objective, and it needs to abandon any populist or sensationalist reporting of news. Of course, there will always be a few organizations that will resist this kind of change, but the more serious news organizations need to embrace objectivity. They also need to provide evidence for their claims, or they should rewrite or update the facts as necessary.

This means that texts must become more hyper-linked, and must reflect more accurately what is going on.

This is very important because ultimately, news articles should demonstrate their bias, in relation to both news stories and their characterizations of people in the news. 

If a report is biased, the bias should be clear so the viewer and the reader can understand the context of the report.

This means that when a reader looks at a report, any bias or agenda should be immediately obvious. There should be something like a 'truth-o-meter' available directly on the articles. 

And it means that when the media makes mistakes or when the media invents news, they will be accountable because ultimately, the news should be objective.

This should lead to an improvement in journalistic standards, where the media becomes more objective, especially with regard to lies and exaggerations emanating from government or business.  Media organizations would of course need to have certain protections in place, to ensure such standards. 

Technology will allow us to reinvent how news is presented. This is another area which Portugal could lead, by creating a media model that is more mature and more accurate than what is currently available. 

Any new model should also look to create new forms of ownership, because media currently depend on specific ownership models that affect their independence.

Investment in talent, expertise, maturity, and adequate remuneration will ensure the skills and standards needed to push the agenda and make governments, industries and individuals accountable for their ideas and actions.
