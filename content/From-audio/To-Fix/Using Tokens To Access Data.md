### Using tokens to access data

There is a problem with users having complete access all the time. One legacy we still have from our days of running everything with admin and a couple of users is the lack of segmentation of user access, especially user access to data, or to a database from a real application. What we want is a situation where whenever someone needs an asset or resource, they make a request and they receive unit tokens to access the specific resource.

The power of this is it not only enforces some of the more explicit accesses, it also allows you to control and limit abuses.

At the moment, the reason for so many data leaks and data dumps is because it is possible for an application to dump all the data in one go, or to just keep asking for the data without anyone noticing. It is too difficult to visualize or understand what is going on at the edges if there is too much in the way. 

Whereas if that application or user had to generate huge quantities of tokens to access that data, it would be easy to monitor.

Visualizing the patterns in a way the web services call 'the sequence of events' allows you to better understand what is going on.

If we did that for assets and accessing assets, we would understand better, and faster, when abuses occur.
