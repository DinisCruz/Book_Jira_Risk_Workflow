### How to deal with teams who say they are already secure and don't have time for security.

Every now and then, you will find a team that has a lot of power.

The team can push back, even at very senior levels of the company, and say "We don't need these threat models, we don't need all these security tasks, or all these security activities you guys ask us to do".

Assuming that the security isn't in an attack space, and there is another team trying to do the right thing, push good practices and add value, then the way to deal with these guys is to call their bluff.

Play them at their own game, and say "Well, if you don't need the threat models or the security tasks, then you better be producing highly secure code, you better have no security vulnerabilities or security exploits, you better fully understand your attack surface, you better have no side effects, and you better have very clean deployments". These are all side effects of bad security practices.

Next, we document their security status, make them accept the various risks, and then wait for Murphy's Law to come along and do the rest.

It is very important to challenge assumptions. For example, if they have pen tests, make sure they understand pen tests aren't worth much unless they are full white-box tests.
