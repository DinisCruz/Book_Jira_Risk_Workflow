### How to deal with problematic teams



So, every now and then you will find a team that says they are already secure, and they don't have time for security. Such teams can have a lot of power, and can push back, even at very senior levels of the company, to say, *"We don't need these threat models, and we don't need to do all these security tasks you are asking for".*

Assuming the company's security isn't in an attack space, or that is has to be dragged by a different team that is trying to do the right thing by pushing good practices and adding value to the company, then the way to deal with a problematic team like this is to call its bluff.

Play them at their own game, and say *"If you won't do these security tasks, your code better be highly secure, you better have no security vulnerabilities or exploits; you better fully understand your attack surface, you better have no side effects and very clean deployments, because these are all the side effects of inadequate security practices."*

Then, you document their security, make them accept all those parts of risks, and then sit back and wait for Murphy's Law to come along and do the rest.

It is also important to challenge their assumptions. If they have pen tests, make sure they understand pen tests are worthless unless they are full white box tests.
