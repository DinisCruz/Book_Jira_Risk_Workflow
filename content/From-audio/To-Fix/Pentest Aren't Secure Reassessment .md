### Pen tests aren't secure assessments

It is essential that business understands that a typical black box pen test, i.e. a test of a website from the outside world, is at most a waste of money, and at best just a check to see if a kid or a non-specific attacker has had a go at your application.

The job of the security assessment is to find the blind spot. Take everything you know about the application, its threat models or assumptions. In fact, take all the ticket items your security champions raised as potential problems, and use those issues to find the blind spot.

In a way, the job of the security assessment is to improve your evidence of the problem, and your evidence of how secure you are.

This means that the testers must have access to everything, and it means that you must capture everything they do. Even the tests that don't produce any findings are very important, because they are your regression tests.

If you can capture all this information, it means that the pen-test or security assessment has added a lot more value to your system.

It also means you scale more, it means you can introduce tests more often because your business benefits from them. 

Therefore, this is also very good for pen-testing teams. They move up the food chain, they become more valuable to the company, rather than being a disposable entity that is part of a race to the bottom to see who can do it cheaper and who can do it in a way that looks good, even though the quality isn't really there. 

As attacks become more real, and as things become more serious, you want the assurance of pen-testing. Companies will need to move into a world where they provide assurance, and provide proof, of what their tests reveal. 

That is why they must provide evidence of what they performed, and that is why they should have access to everything that exists on the application.

Once you have the findings, you can make a risk-based decision on whether your current level of attackers can or will discover the vulnerabilities, and, more importantly, can you perform those actions in a way they will detect.

Because if you can detect how certain vulnerabilities are exploited, and you can quickly mitigate and prevent further damage, then you can argue to leave them on, because they no longer pose a big problem.
