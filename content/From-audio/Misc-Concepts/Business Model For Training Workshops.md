### A business model for training workshops

Workshops and training sessions with respected and knowledgeable security experts have a lot of potential as a training model.

The idea is that if companies need an injection of talent or knowledge to make sure that they are going in the right direction, or to have the confidence to tell management what direction it should take, a training session with a security expert can provide that knowledge and reassurance.

However, how do you scale this? Because the experts are very expensive, and very busy; they may not be available to join a company team as an employee. 

Whether their expertise lies in cryptography, SSL, spring security, or in more generic application security fields, such as threat modeling or Geo workflows; you then bring that expert into the organization for anything from an hour to a couple of days, possibly spread over weeks or months. 

The experts will not have the time to manage or even find this kind of work, so special agencies should be created to manage this work.  The agents will find and book the training sessions, and they will follow up on any other logistical arrangements. They act as a go-between, because there is a lot of work involved in these kinds of arrangements.  

The agencies will shield the professionals from the logistical side of things, so they can get on and do their security work. In effect, the agent model manages and sells the talent, i.e. the InfoSec and AppSec experts. 

The key question is: what is the financial model? It must be fair to both the expert who creates the value and provides the training, and the agent who markets, sells, and manages that talent.  

One option is an even split, where 50% goes to the presenter and 50% goes to the agency, which is similar to what happens in other situations. If it was a 64%/36% split, with 64% going to the presenter, we would need to be sure that is enough of an incentive for the agent, because they would spend a lot of time selling to people who won't buy the service. So, I come back to the 50/50 as a fair amount, and a fair division of the fee.

There needs to be total transparency between all parties. That will require trust, and it also creates a bonding relationship where it becomes harder for the expert to deal with a company or an individual directly, and exclude the agent from some contracts.  

It is important to create something that isn't too asymmetric, where if, for example, 25% went to the expert, then that person might decide to approach companies directly. 

That is the first kind of model that I think could work quite well, but it is important that the concept and the paradigm is really about the agents. The agency's website should really advertise and sell the talent to the user. 

Because higher profile experts can generate higher fees, they could basically push that transparency quite high up. Ultimately, market demand for specific individuals should dictate the fees. Politicians and celebrities charge a lot of money for appearances or speeches because of demand, and because there is a finite resource. When you look at security experts, there is a finite resource of individuals that can provide that kind of training and lead that kind of workshop.

Fundamentally this model is based on agents, and then talent, and ultimately it is about treating the talent well. The better the talent is treated, the longer the relationship will last. 

From an expert's point of view, I think it is also fundamental that the model doesn't require a lot of background work on their part. The agent does the background work, and the expert should be able to go in to a company, present and talk about their work. 

This model will also allow security experts to stay in companies that might not pay very well, but that provide interesting projects, or other advantages to them. If these experts could have one day a month, or one day a week, working in training sessions they could top up their salaries and find a better balance between work and remuneration.
