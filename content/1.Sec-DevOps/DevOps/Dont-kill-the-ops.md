### Don't kill the Ops

DevOps is not a cost saving exercise, and DevOps should not be seen as a way to kill or reduce Ops. No one wants to see a situation develop where Dev + Ops -> DevOps -> Dev. 

I have seen crazy situations where the idea that the 'Ops' team would be made redundant was seriously considered as a viable plan.
