### When devs become cloud administrators

When moving to the cloud, devs often become System Administrators. This is a problem, and it creates many security issues. 

In some cases, this move is nothing more than _'throwing the baby out with the bath water'_ ,where a lack of innovation, speed, and features from the local admin or IT teams push the developers to have free reign in the cloud (like AWS), where they can create servers and VMs in seconds as opposed to days, weeks or months.
