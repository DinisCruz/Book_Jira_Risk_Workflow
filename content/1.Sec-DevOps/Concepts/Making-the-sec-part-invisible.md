### Making the Sec part invisble

There is a theory that a lot of the work done today (2016) in AppSec and SecDevOps is part of a transition into DevOps, that will be achieved when security is embedded into the Dev SDL (Security Development Lifecycle), and when security becomes invisible.

The biggest advantages of Microsoft's security push has been the quality and robustness of their products, and the improvement in their SDL. 

In 2012 I made the following observations in my [blog](Secure coding (and Application Security) must be invisible to developers):

>At OWASP a while back we come up with the idea that '...Our [OWASP] mission is to make application security visible...' and for a while I used to believe in the idea that if only everybody had full visibility into 'Application Security' then we would solve the problem.

>But after a while I started to realize that what we need to create for developers, is for 'Application Security' / 'Secure Coding' to be INVISIBLE 99% of the time. It is only the decision makers (namely the buyers) that need visibility into an application's secure state. . .

>. . . The core idea is that developers should be using Frameworks, APIs and Languages that allow them to create secure applications by design (where security is there but is invisible to developers).

>And when they (the developers or architects) create a security vulnerability, at that moment (and only then), they should have visibility into what they created (i.e. the side effects) and be shown alternative ways to do the same thing in a secure way.

>This is how we can scale, which is why it is critical that OWASP (and anybody who cares about solving the application security problem) needs to focus in improving our Framework's ability to create secure apps.
