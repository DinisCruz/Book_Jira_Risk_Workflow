###  SecDevOps or DevSecOps

Which term is better? And which one sends the better message? 

DevSecOps seems to get more [Google queries](https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore?q=secdevops,devsecops).
Furthermore, DevSecOps has the advantage that puts Dev (Development) first. This is fitting as 'Development' is most important part of the term. 
However, SecDevOps is a good extension of DevOps, which is a known practice, and I also like the idea that when Security becomes embedded in the SDL, Sec-DevOps then becomes DevOps.

I like the definitions given [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devsecops-secdevops-difference-kumar-mba-msc-cissp-mbcs-citp).
