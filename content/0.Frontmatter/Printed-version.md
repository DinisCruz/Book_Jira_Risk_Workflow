## Printed version

If you are reading this on a digital device, here are some reasons why you might want to consider buying the printed book [^printed-book]:

  * better way to learn the concepts in this book (see ["Physical Books are the best technology for reading"](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/09/physical-books-are-best-technology-for.html))
  * better graphs and diagrams (which are easier to understand and cross reference on paper)
  * helps funding the development of this and other books (that I'm working on)



[^printed-book]: the printed version of this book will be created after the first v1.0 release, and will be released at lulu.com and Amazon.
